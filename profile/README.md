## Who we are
We are a free subdomain service who provide sweet-looking `.is-a.dev` subdomains for developers!

Heads over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register) to get started. Alternatively, you can also join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/is-a-dev-830872854677422150) and run `/register` in the commands channel.

## Why use us?
- We support many types of records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT)
- We are on the [Public Suffix List](https://www.publicsuffix.org) (meaning your subdomain is treated as its own root domain!)
- Quick PR response times*
- Fast support for issues
- [Documentation](https://www.is-a.dev/docs), covering using our subdomains with many different services

###### *Response times may vary based on the amount of PRs we are receiving.
